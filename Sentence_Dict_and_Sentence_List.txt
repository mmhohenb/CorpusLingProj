6123 Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.
230 "No sign of it?"
2511 "9th.
24 I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
1060 It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
1474 In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.
2608 You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee.
4121 "But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
2082 "Surely it would not be difficult to find out.
5317 The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.
13 My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.
6607 "There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
4976 "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
1896 You have been of material assistance to me."
1962 "But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
3584 "So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him.
545 She responded beautifully.
4548 "I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
3840 "'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
5691 "Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
5462 He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
4205 "I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.
6273 It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
1310 "And your mother is alive?"
202 "Pooh, pooh!
2801 "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
3732 "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
1957 It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was.
197 "No legal papers or certificates?"
2647 Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.
2792 Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
3453 What of it, then?
3006 "Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
2098 "Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him.
6502 "Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances.
3303 I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me.
1252 "I can quite understand your thinking so," I said.
1001 Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.
4781 'For the love of Heaven!'
4209 Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.
6635 "'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
2944 Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
1204 What could it be?
4928 "Good heavens!"
1729 I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference.
5347 "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?"
2218 I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy.
3765 Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance.
4650 Now we can talk in safety.'
5771 Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground.
3534 "It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.
2794 Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer.
4732 It was a chestnut."
4676 I should be compelled to stop the night.'
3565 By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
482 she asked.
3167 "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.
5765 "'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!'
6755 We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to.
1583 It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.
4758 "I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry.
3156 "Yes."
6269 said I.
4996 "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat.
2548 To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
228 Twice she has been waylaid.
4782 she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'
3347 "So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."
3841 "'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'
4776 "'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for.
2054 You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
5817 "Yes, it was twisted."
4614 During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.
5910 We must come back to that.
4494 Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.
45 "It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.
917 "'Yes.'
5278 "I did not say a probable one.
4451 He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.
3786 Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.
2049 Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
5178 "In mining.
3729 "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
3859 "'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
2466 K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.'"
1547 "On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
895 Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
58 "Well, some hundreds of times."
2682 The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose.
2035 What is this, then?
2527 You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.
1683 The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
4308 There is one point which I should wish to determine."
6006 "Oh, so so.
4629 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
3358 And, first, as to how it came here.
1086 "I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
3225 The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.
3668 D'you see?
1847 Never let yourself doubt upon that point.
4250 Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
1311 "Oh, yes, mother is alive and well.
5084 Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product.
87 "Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes.
4538 "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."
5088 Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.
2274 James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel.
304 Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.
6652 I would send you a wire.
1837 She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.
4187 It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.
6555 I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk.
681 "Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
4221 You must lock yourself up from him to-night.
4394 We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."
6317 Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.'
1275 Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.
5133 His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked.
6364 If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--" "Danger!
3266 What can I do?"
3128 Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
6757 "My God!"
5458 I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
466 "What then?"
4595 We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him.
4069 I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
4020 We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."
5412 He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat.
6550 As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.
199 "Then I fail to follow your Majesty.
5729 "I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
4524 There he is, all safe and sound.
6390 The summons was a brief and urgent one.
3258 "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
5736 Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.
5775 I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
721 "Well, I never!"
4958 "There are several quiet little villages up there."
2494 It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."
3886 Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.
1054 Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.
3963 As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
6066 "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
1840 He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life.
6063 "There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
5022 It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.
4832 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'
5965 "Thank you.
4616 Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
433 His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.
3181 "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
5182 The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.
4822 When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.
5390 You're mad!
3208 "Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's.
1225 "And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?"
3139 "Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
4503 I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
2937 The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.
1514 And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."
2836 It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.
5281 "Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.
660 "Certainly, if you wish it."
6128 I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son.
846 Wilson!'
2825 "Then I shall go in it.
3580 This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas.
3536 "And you can do nothing until then?"
6384 he cried impatiently.
3310 I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames.
3735 "No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly.
5469 Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa.
2405 "When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up.
3874 "Get out!"
2746 I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
6094 His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.
2535 The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
1123 It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.
3471 I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately.
1845 I know that James didn't do it.
6323 Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number.
1125 Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
4534 I took it up and glanced at it.
107 "Precisely.
142 he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.
3117 "Very much so."
3361 In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.
2892 He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.
5625 "'Precisely.'
1825 "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
1576 "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.
4511 At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
5126 There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."
5919 "He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
307 Chubb lock to the door.
852 "Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
2356 With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
4399 This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.
5790 You may go to any expense which you think necessary.
2856 "I was certainly surprised to find you there."
2246 It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.
445 "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.
4690 "'Entirely.'
6240 capital!'
5885 "The stable lane?"
5033 "And from a noble client?"
492 May we bring him in, marm?"
5492 "When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend.
1786 "The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?
1834 "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said.
724 "I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining.
4279 "Very strange!"
1675 In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."
4302 "Well, look at this!"
1666 "Not a word.
1198 From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
1410 "None."
5559 The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual.
6516 This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up.
5219 She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.
4591 "I'll do better.
1472 Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.
3483 John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.
1679 I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
3800 said Holmes sternly.
1097 He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
744 "Very good.
2401 "The letter arrived on March 10, 1883.
1897 "You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.
594 I wish she had been of my own station!
790 As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.
1598 Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced.
5191 "I brought this with me."
3944 "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara.
6464 As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.
4877 How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.
5743 He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength.
2016 To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass.
2391 Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil.
328 That sounded ominous.
6109 "Is it possible?"
3262 "It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
60 "How many?
763 That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker.
2569 "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it.
1649 "Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you.
3424 But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"
5892 "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.
4211 "All has turned out splendidly.
1044 I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it.
2257 His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight.
4455 "What can it mean?"
1643 Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
2078 "It is solved."
4024 A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.
343 As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road.
3811 "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he.
2600 And now let us consider another point.
4675 I suppose there would be no chance of a train back.
4036 She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.
6417 "They always fill me with a certain horror.
2443 I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'
5611 "'The firm does so when the security is good.'
4667 "'To Eyford, in Berkshire.
3035 I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
2225 In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past.
6140 So far I was clear.
6248 "'And what salary do you ask?'
4417 I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.
194 "Precisely so.
3059 The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
3314 Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."
1552 Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side.
63 You have not observed.
6014 I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room.
3740 Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.
4748 "It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
3478 "Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago.
1222 The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.
3350 Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
3933 There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
3975 He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.
3064 "How can you tell that?"
560 She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.
3888 Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.
6400 "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
1989 Do you not deduce something from that?"
5926 "I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he.
2941 Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat.
5087 Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire.
4751 I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material.
5907 You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
905 But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
4297 "Only once, some years ago.
3050 Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
4368 "No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.
4406 There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.
6236 A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
6264 The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
5244 I had something else to think of."
1688 Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.
3501 "Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.
643 Would she not have made an admirable queen?
2791 Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
3911 "My name is Sherlock Holmes.
865 "'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else.
5643 I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'
6459 There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street.
5633 "'Not at all.
2023 I have no time!
4219 What will he say when he returns?"
2367 he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
5607 I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England.
976 "Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
4673 It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'
1188 He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
512 "You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked.
4501 The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
4264 "No, I never heard of her using it.
3119 "Yes."
6098 In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room.
5223 "Indeed!
1463 Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.
3989 The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.
3801 "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
1780 "The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
4091 There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
758 It is not a common experience among employers in this age.
1755 My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom.
2858 "I came to find a friend."
4143 "What has she been saying to you?"
3238 "Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."
809 There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
6192 You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."
5188 On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman.
4867 Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'
2961 "He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
617 To be left till called for."
395 Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.
5707 I answered sharply.
3327 But if you are found again, then all must come out.
1346 "Yes, sir.
1879 No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it."
3031 "Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."
3827 "My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word.
1914 Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
5388 "On the contrary, this is the right side."
6059 he gasped.
1234 "Alas!
791 He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.
1901 "I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.
3979 She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."
4323 I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.
6360 I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
1099 We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
6145 There could be no possible reason.
5811 "Terrible!
2290 Who could come to-night?
5184 During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster.
4046 Could you swear to it?"
2235 He asked for Alice.
2331 I am the last court of appeal."
2609 If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
1634 "And Miss Sutherland?"
1493 "Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel.
62 "Quite so!
6715 "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."
4754 "'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door.
1715 "Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully.
4395 "Subtle enough and horrible enough.
5501 Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."
626 Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.
5866 "But I am so sure that he is innocent.
2283 All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
5288 "Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling.
6467 She was a nonentity.
6147 When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.
3509 Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it.
5754 "'Yes, thief!'
963 "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
6681 Of course there is only one feasible explanation.
6426 It is the five miles of country which makes the danger.
629 Male costume is nothing new to me.
3373 The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.
6182 "To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.
3187 asked Holmes.
3971 Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.
4218 "He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.
2645 "Then the page we have seen--" "Is such as we might expect.
4900 It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself.
3051 "What!"
4960 "Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion.
5957 Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
5094 Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield.
3902 She is waiting now in the sitting-room.
585 "To an English lawyer named Norton."
1843 she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come.
5673 "It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn.
2798 As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
1931 A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious.
2590 As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors.
5942 This case, I presume, contains the coronet.
185 said Holmes.
2186 "I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl.
6588 "'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he.
5853 On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance.
1810 They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."
2050 "It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner.
1260 "Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.
4309 He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.
630 I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives.
1345 Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
4340 Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.
2560 "Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
1240 "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked.
4910 The name was strange to him.
6801 Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
5519 I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night."
2782 How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
1454 Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me.
743 Just two months ago."
4948 I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."
659 he cried.
4880 The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
2242 We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
5206 "Yes."
755 But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
6534 "You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.
6049 "That would be unnecessary.
4461 Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.
1109 said Holmes severely.
2105 then?"
2755 "You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder.
1831 I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination.
5540 "It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know.
5936 "That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."
4535 "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)."
6272 The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester.
648 I know that her word is inviolate.
5413 "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."
5251 "She walked into the breakfast-room."
4907 There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.
2915 Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
4235 I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."
3632 "Fine birds they were, too.
5832 What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"
2935 "This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
354 "My cabby drove fast.
5123 "Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."
5787 A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.
4522 "It's a new patient," he whispered.
4376 "Oh, yes, I did.
5315 Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
4052 "Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place.
6562 It was my coil of hair.
5109 It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding': "'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding.
929 "I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.
1133 But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
6491 You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'
3795 I swear it.
2669 The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered.
6042 I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."
3507 "Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one.
2651 "You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."
6239 Capital!
2874 "If I can be of use."
1477 The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was.
3787 You then--" Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees.
1249 "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.
4112 She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
3449 "The goose, Mr. Holmes!
5613 "'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have 50,000 pounds at once.
2160 "I could see that the end had not been in his mouth.
4973 You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.
281 And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.
5312 "Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.
3665 You see this little book?"
3802 "I will fly, Mr. Holmes.
684 "You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.
5572 Ha!
6105 He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight.
3026 He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."
1500 Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once.
678 "Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.
4292 "What's in here?"
947 And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson.
4674 "'Then we can hardly get there before midnight.
5374 F.H.M.'
2624 There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
3040 she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
2280 The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records.
5453 It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
4847 By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.
5036 "I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
5847 I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.
141 "You had my note?"
6666 "Yes."
2161 Therefore he used a holder.
5797 "Do you receive much company?"
3543 By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
168 The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
1081 He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay.
3020 "No bad?"
1848 We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.
3950 replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman.
4478 Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.
5116 The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
6107 In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye.
1293 "I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking."
654 "Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
5566 I asked.
5024 With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.
6142 "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
717 I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
2906 "Proceed, then."
3467 It is the precious stone."
2672 The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."
1330 Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
4669 There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about "'Very good.'
4898 I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
3042 "You think that he is dead?"
317 So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.
2422 'Here are the very letters.
6215 "It is half-past ten now."
5425 Ha!
5481 But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew.
6640 "'I am sure if I had known--' "'Well, then, you know now.
1525 It was the bisulphate of baryta."
463 They did not know how to look."
1754 It ran in this way: "Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.
3784 What did you do, then?
5445 "I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes.
830 A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
4899 "How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.
2602 Does that suggest anything?"
4714 "'I shall certainly be there.'
5755 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
4539 "Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed.
401 "You must leave that to me.
252 "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
5930 This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.
2103 Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
2313 "I have come for advice."
4643 No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
3334 Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places.
4331 Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
2197 Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.
4133 asked this apparition.
6492 "The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.
5177 "And how did he make his money?"
5806 "That is unusual in a young girl."
2542 "By train from Waterloo."
1857 "There, now!"
2545 And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."
3312 "I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.
33 "Indeed, I should have thought a little more.
2223 I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
2652 "What steps will you take?"
5083 "There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week.
26 It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.
6068 You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."
4440 Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.
1175 You seem to have done the thing very completely.
3941 At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
5801 No one else, I think."
3861 I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'
6690 So much is fairly clear.
3274 "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
5867 You know what woman's instincts are.
5888 Ah!
4146 "Ha!
3166 "I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots.
191 Retired from operatic stage--ha!
384 By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."
2580 Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."
5663 My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it.
553 I asked.
2484 Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air.
855 'And the pay?'
6742 "You villain!"
883 "This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work.
4932 It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.
1600 But the deception could not be kept up forever.
4207 Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.
5667 People tell me that I have spoiled him.
3527 In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.
3111 But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"
4316 "What do you make of that, Watson?"
418 "Entirely."
4170 "Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!
2420 "He looked inside the envelope.
106 "The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
6558 I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
4884 You said it should not be again.
3307 But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.
2508 Same old platform.
4094 Yet we have not a moment to lose.
2898 "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
6117 And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
3176 We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine.

Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.
"No sign of it?"
"9th.
I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.
You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee.
"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
"Surely it would not be difficult to find out.
The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.
My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.
"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
"Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
You have been of material assistance to me."
"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him.
She responded beautifully.
"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
